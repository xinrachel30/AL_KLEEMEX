### ALTester
We populated _data with 23 integer values by using typecasting
(Math.random times 20). isSorted uses a for loop to iterate through every value
of _data to check if the value is not smaller than value succeeding it. If any
value is greater than the one succeeding it, isSorted returns false.

### OrderedArrayList
- toString: It creates String foo and starts with an open bracket. It iterates
through the array and adds every value to foo. It adds a closing bracket
and returns foo.
- addLinear: In progress. It should iterate through the array and compare each
value with newVal. When it finds a value that is greater than newVal, it should
add newVal at that index.
